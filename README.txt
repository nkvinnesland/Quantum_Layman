Quantum Computing Instagram Snippets

Welcome to the Quantum Computing Snippets repository! This repo contains code examples and visualizations used for educational Instagram posts. Each post explores a fundamental concept in quantum computing, ranging from superposition and entanglement to teleportation and more!

Repository Contents

This repository contains Python scripts that use Qiskit to demonstrate key quantum computing concepts. Each script is designed to generate visualizations (e.g., Bloch spheres, circuit diagrams) that are easy to understand and share.
